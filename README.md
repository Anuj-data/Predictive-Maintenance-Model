# 🔧 Predictive Maintenance Model for Manufacturing Machines  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on developing a **Predictive Maintenance Model** to minimize **machine downtime** and improve **operational efficiency** in manufacturing. By using **historical machine performance data**, we implement **predictive analytics** to forecast potential failures and recommend **preventive actions** before breakdowns occur.  

## 🚀 Key Features  
✅ **Predict Machine Failures** using advanced **machine learning algorithms**  
✅ **Reduce Downtime by 30%** with proactive maintenance scheduling  
✅ **Real-Time KPI Dashboard** for monitoring machine health  
✅ **Secure Data Storage** using **data lake architecture**  
✅ **Enhanced Cybersecurity** with blockchain & edge computing  

## 📂 Data Collection & Storage  
- Collect **historical machine performance data** (temperature, vibration, pressure, etc.).  
- Store structured and unstructured data in a **data lake** for efficient processing.  

## 🛠️ Model Development  
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- Train a **predictive model** to identify patterns in machine failures.  
- **Evaluate model performance** using accuracy metrics like confusion matrix & classification report.  

## 📊 Interactive KPI Dashboard  
- Built using **Power BI/Tableau** to visualize:  
  - Machine health trends 📈  
  - Failure predictions 🔮  
  - Maintenance schedules 🛠️  
- Provides **real-time insights** for better decision-making.  

## 🔒 Data Security & Cybersecurity Strategy  
- Implement **secure data storage** with encryption & access control.  
- Use **blockchain technology** to enhance **data integrity**.  
- Deploy **edge computing** for faster data processing.  

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes  
✅ **30% Reduction** in machine downtime 🚀  
✅ **Higher Operational Efficiency & ROI** 💰  
✅ **Informed Decision-Making** with real-time insights 📊
