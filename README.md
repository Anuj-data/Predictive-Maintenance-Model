# Predictive-Maintenance-Model
This project focuses on developing a Predictive Maintenance Model to enhance manufacturing efficiency by minimizing machine downtime and preventing unexpected failures. Using historical machine performance data, we build a predictive analytics model to forecast potential failures and recommend preventive actions before breakdowns occur.
